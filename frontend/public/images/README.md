# Images Folder

Place your images here:

## Required Images:
- **`logo.png`** - FoodConnect logo (your custom logo with strawberry, heart, fork, and leaf)

### Logo Specifications:
- **Recommended size**: 200x200px or larger (square format works best)
- **File format**: PNG with transparency (supports the glowing effect)
- **Location**: Place your logo file here as `logo.png`

## Image Paths:
All images should be referenced as:
- `/images/logo.png` (for logo - used throughout the site)
- `/images/your-image.jpg` (for other images)

## Logo Features:
Your logo includes:
- 🍓 Strawberry (orange glow - Color 1: #E2852E)
- ❤️ Heart (orange glow - Color 1: #E2852E)
- 🍴 Fork (centered in heart)
- 🍃 Leaf (yellow glow - Color 2/3: #F5C857/#FFEE91)

## Note:
- If `logo.png` is missing, a fallback SVG placeholder will be displayed automatically
- The fallback uses your brand color (Orange #E2852E)
- All HTML files are already configured to use `/images/logo.png`

## Quick Setup:
1. Save your logo file as `logo.png`
2. Place it in this folder: `foodconnect67/frontend/public/images/logo.png`
3. Refresh your browser - the logo will appear automatically!
